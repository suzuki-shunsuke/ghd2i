## Customize templates

You can customize templates of issue body and issue comments.

Create a configuration file:

```sh
ghd2i create-config
```

Please edit the generated configuration file as you like.

Before creating issues, you can test the configuration by `-dry-run` option:

```sh
ghd2i run -dry-run [-data <data file>] [<discussion url> ...]
```

## Configuration file

Configuration file is optional.
By default, if a file `\.ghd2i.yaml` exists, it's used as a configuration file.
You can also specify the configuration file by `-config` option.

```sh
ghd2i run -config config.yaml <discussion url>
```

Templates are parsed using [Go's text/template](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template).

```yaml
issue_template: |
  A template of issue body.
  This is parsed using Go's text/template.
comment_template: |+
  A template of issue comments.
  This is parsed using Go's text/template.
```

Each discussion in data is passed to `issue_template`.
Each discussion comment in data is passed to `comment_template`.

## Close and Lock created Issues

By default, ghd2i closes issues if discussions are closed.
And it locks issues if discussion are locked.
You can change this behaviour using `-lock` and `-close` option.
These options accept the following values.

- `auto` (default): closes and locks issues if discussions are closed and locks
- `always`: closes and locks issues definitely
- `never`: never closes and locks issues

e.g.

```sh
ghd2i run -lock never -close always <discussion url>
```

## Q. Why not using GitHub's native feature `Create issue from discussion`?

GitHub provides a Web UI to create an issue from a discussion.

<img width="254" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2899fc15-3c6b-4ea0-8d3a-65d162032c67">

But we think this feature is very poor.

This feature doesn't create issue comments from discussion comments and replies.

So we've developed ghd2i.
